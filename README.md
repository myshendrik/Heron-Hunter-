# Heron-Hunter-
I want to detect herons in my garden and try to chase them away using a Reolink RLC-520A and Home Assistant.

I have a pool in the garden en herons often come to try to eat my fish.
A couple of weeks ago I bought a system/sensor to chase these herons away while I'm not home but...

It doesn't do what its made for... Heron's keep comming and are not affraid of the sound and flashing light
made by the sensor.

The idea of this project is: I CAN DO BETTER

I want to realise this project by using a Reolink RLC-520A connected to Frigate running in Home Assistant on my raspberry Pi5.
I want to train an AI model who can detect herons from the video comming from the camera.
I want to chase the herons away once detected. (How, I still don't know)

This is my firts Github project.

Fingers crossed and lets try to create something.
